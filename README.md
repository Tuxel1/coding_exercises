# coding_exercises
A repository to store minor coding projects I am doing to improve my coding
skills.

I am taking inspiration from [this](https://github.com/karan/Projects) 
list of beginner projects.

## Projects so far

Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for 
multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of 
five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 
“FizzBuzz”.

Pig Latin - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language 
game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant 
sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" 
would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

Vigenere / Vernam / Ceasar Ciphers - Functions for encrypting and decrypting 
data messages. Then send them to a friend.
